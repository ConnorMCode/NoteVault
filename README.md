# NoteVault

This is a small local notekeeping application using a project structure inspired by Cherno's C++ project template. [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.

## README
-Ensure you either recursive clone or add the ImGui repository to the ThirdParty folder for the program to work properly

-Setup scripts to initialize project files are located in 'Scripts', these use the Build.lua, Build-App.lua, and Build-Core.lua to setup linking and file access so any added directories should be reflected there.
